<h3>A Good Study Bible</h3>
<img src="img/bible.jpg"/>
<p>I would enjoy having a study bible with a more scholarly translation to use in concert with the King James I already have. I often use The New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) and think it would best fit my needs. Both the <a href="http://bit.ly/1EKem9p">Harper Collins</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/1EPz6hG">Oxford</a> editions are well-regarded and their inclusion of apocryphal books is a definite plus. If I were to select an edition of either Bible, I would choose the <a href="http://bit.ly/1zrEaWC">older</a> edition of the Oxford (which should be largely similar to the newest edition) or the <a href="http://bit.ly/1ByMzMP">student edition</a> of the Harper Collins (which merely lacks the concordance of the more expensive version). Additionally, BYU Professors generally require either the Harper Collins or Oxford editions for their literary Bible courses and so both can be found on occasion in the textbook section of the BYU Store.</p>

<h3>Sunglasses</h3>
<img src="img/sunglasses.jpg"/>
<p>Often when I am driving in the sun I end up borrowing Daphna's sunglasses so that I can see the road without having to squint.  A simple pair of sunglasses would help us both be able to protect our eyes and drive without squinting.  Since I already wear glasses, a pair that goes over ordinary glasses would be best.

<h3>Pajama Pants</h3>
<p>My most recent pair of pajama pants have finally worn out.  I now end up wearing gym shorts or track pants to bed on most nights. It would be nice to have a something a little warmer and softer (like fleece or flannel) pants to wear to bed. I ordinarly wear pants with a 34 inch waist and 32 inch length and prefer my pajamas comfortably loose.</p>
<h3>Granta Magazine</h3>
<p>When in doubt I always enjoy reading issues of Granta magazine. Old issues are usually quite cheap on Amazon and any issue from their entire print run is available on <a href="http://www.granta.com">their website</a>.  I already own issues: 8, 31, 75, 112, 113, and 119.</p>

<h3>Shoe Rack</h3>
<p>I am just looking for something to store our shoes so any kind of shoe rack will do.</p>

<p>Any of these movies would be lovely:</p>

</ul>

<h3>Tangle Teezer Brush</h3>
<img src="img/tangle_teezer.jpg"/>
<p>I've heard <a href="http://www.tangleteezer.com/index.php">these brushes</a> are good for detangling, but a wide tooth comb would work as an alternative.</p>
<h3>Cutting Board</h3>
<p>It would be nice to have another cutting board.</p>
<h3>Bread Knife</h3>
<p>We're currently lacking a decent serrated knife for cutting bread.</p>
<h3>Anchor Earrings</h3>
<p>Earrings that look like anchors could be really cute.</p>
<h3>I've Got Your Number - Sophie Kinsella</h3>
<img src="img/got_your_number.jpg"/>
<p>This is the <a href="http://bit.ly/1wGUQWT">only book</a> from Kinsella that I do not own and it would be nice to complete my collection.</p>
